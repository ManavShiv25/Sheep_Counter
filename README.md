# Sheep_Counter
## Using the help of an arduino and 2 PIR sensors, we can effectively track and count the number of sheep moving in and out.
The sensors are placed along the fence, and if a sheep triggers the first sensor and then the second, we can conclude that it has moved in to the field.
Similarly, if the second sensor is triggered and then the first, we can conclude that a sheep has moved out of the field.
